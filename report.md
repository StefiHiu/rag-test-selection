    ## 📝 Detailed Developer Summary
    This commit refactors the summarization logic and enhances the CI/CD pipeline.

1.  **File Renaming & Refactoring**: The `analysis/summarizer.py` has been renamed to `analysis/gemini_summarizer.py` to more accurately reflect that it uses the Gemini model.
2.  **Dependency Cleanup**: Unused imports (`openai`, `change_detector`) have been removed from `gemini_summarizer.py`.
3.  **Removal of Standalone Execution**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block has been removed, converting the file from a script into a pure library module. The orchestration logic is now handled elsewhere.
4.  **CI Workflow Update**: The GitHub Actions workflow (`main.yml`) has been updated to include a new step that uploads the generated `report.md` as a build artifact named `rag-orchestrator-report`. This makes the analysis results easily accessible after a run.
