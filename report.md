üîç Detailed Developer Summary:

  This commit refactors how environment configuration and API keys are managed. A new centralized function, `get_environment_config`, has been introduced in `analysis/change_detector.py` to handle loading configuration for both local development (using `.env` files) and GitHub Actions environments. The `detect_changes` function in the same file and the API key initialization in `analysis/gemini_summarizer.py` have been updated to use this new utility. This change improves modularity, removes redundant code, and makes configuration management more robust.

üí¨ Generated Response:
Excellent. This is a classic and critical type of refactoring. As an expert QA engineer, my analysis is as follows.

Based on the information provided, there are no existing test cases to re-execute.

However, a change of this nature is fundamental to the application's ability to run and function correctly. Refactoring configuration and secret management is a high-risk change that affects the entire application stack. The absence of relevant test cases is a major gap that must be addressed immediately.

Therefore, I recommend **creating and executing a new suite of tests** focused on configuration loading and validation.

Here are the essential test cases that should be created and executed to validate this change:

### Recommended New Test Cases

**1. Test Case: Local Environment Validation with `.env` file**
*   **Rationale:** The description explicitly states support for local `.env` files. This is the primary path for local development and must be verified. We need to ensure the new utility function correctly parses and provides variables from this file.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Create a valid `.env` file with a test API key.
    *   Run the application locally.
    *   Verify that the application initializes successfully and that the component using the API key is correctly configured with the value from the `.env` file.

**2. Test Case: CI/CD Environment Validation with GitHub Actions Secrets**
*   **Rationale:** This validates the second critical path mentioned in the description. A failure here would break all automated builds, tests, and deployments. We need to confirm the application can consume environment variables injected as secrets in a CI/CD environment.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Run the application within a test workflow in GitHub Actions.
    *   Configure a test secret (e.g., `API_KEY`) in the GitHub repository settings.
    *   Verify the application starts and correctly reads the secret's value.

**3. Test Case: Graceful Failure on Missing Configuration**
*   **Rationale:** The centralized utility function is a single point of failure. If configuration is missing, the application should fail fast with a clear, descriptive error message (e.g., "FATAL: Required configuration 'API_KEY' is missing.") rather than crashing with a null pointer exception later on.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Attempt to run the application in an environment where neither a `.env` file is present nor are the required environment variables/secrets set.
    *   Assert that the application exits with a specific, informative error message and a non-zero exit code.

**4. Test Case: End-to-End Functional Test**
*   **Rationale:** This is the most important validation. We must confirm that a feature relying on the configured API key still works as expected after the refactoring. This proves that the new configuration mechanism is not only loading the key but is also providing it correctly to the dependent services.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Execute an existing end-to-end test that makes a call to an external service using the API key. If one doesn't exist, create a new one.
    *   Run this test in both the local (`.env`) and CI (secrets) environments.
    *   Assert that the API call is successful (e.g., receives a 200 OK response).

In summary, while there are no existing tests to **re-execute**, this change mandates the **creation** of a new, robust set of tests. Changes to configuration logic are foundational, and without these validation steps, we cannot have confidence that the application will run reliably in any environment.
