    - Message: updated report formatting, and included metadata

üîç Detailed Developer Summary:

  This commit introduces several enhancements to the change analysis and reporting pipeline. The `change_detector.py` script now extracts commit metadata (author, timestamp, message). This metadata is then passed through `main.py` to `write_report.py` to be included in a new 'Commit Metadata' section in the final report. The commit message is also now passed to `gemini_summarizer.py` to provide additional context for summary generation. A significant change occurs in `llm_utils.py`, where the logic for generating test case recommendations has been migrated from a local OpenAI-compatible model to the Google Gemini Pro API. The direct output from this new LLM is also captured and added to the final report. Finally, minor configuration updates were made in `src/retriever.py` to use a more specific `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

üí¨ Generated Response:
Based on the code change description, no relevant existing test cases were found to re-execute.

However, as an expert QA engineer, I must emphasize that the described changes are significant and introduce new functionality and critical integration points. The absence of relevant existing test cases indicates a major gap in test coverage that must be addressed.

A comprehensive testing strategy is crucial. I recommend creating and executing a new suite of tests focusing on the following areas:

### Recommended New Test Categories

#### 1. Gemini API Integration & Logic Tests

This is the highest-risk area. We need to verify that the new external service call is working correctly and that the system can handle its responses and potential failures.

*   **Happy Path Functional Test:**
    *   **Why:** To confirm that for a valid code change, the system correctly formats a request, calls the Gemini API, receives a valid list of test cases, and successfully parses that list. This is the primary success criterion.
*   **Error Handling - API Unavailability:**
    *   **Why:** The Gemini API is an external dependency that can fail. This test should simulate a network error or the API being down to ensure our system handles it gracefully (e.g., fails with a clear error message, has a retry mechanism, or falls back to a default state) instead of crashing.
*   **Error Handling - Invalid API Key/Authentication Failure:**
    *   **Why:** To verify that the system provides a clear and immediate failure message if the API key is incorrect or has been revoked. This prevents downstream confusion and aids in rapid configuration debugging.
*   **Error Handling - Malformed or Empty API Response:**
    *   **Why:** The API contract could change, or a bug in the LLM's response generation could lead to unexpected formats (e.g., bad JSON, empty list). We must ensure our system can safely handle these edge cases without failing.
*   **Performance/Timeout Test:**
    *   **Why:** API calls add latency. We need to measure the time taken for the test selection process and ensure it's within an acceptable range. We also need to verify that our system has a reasonable timeout and doesn't hang indefinitely waiting for a slow API response.

#### 2. Report Generation Tests

The report is a key user-facing artifact. Its content and structure must be validated.

*   **Report Content Validation - Commit Metadata:**
    *   **Why:** To verify that the newly added commit metadata (e.g., commit hash, author, message) is correctly retrieved and accurately displayed in the final report.
*   **Report Content Validation - LLM Raw Response:**
    *   **Why:** To confirm that the direct, verbatim response from the LLM is included in the report as specified. This is crucial for debugging the test selection logic and understanding *why* certain tests were chosen.
*   **Report Schema/Structure Validation:**
    *   **Why:** To ensure the overall structure of the report remains valid and that the new sections have not broken the existing format. This can be automated by validating the report against a defined schema (e.g., JSON Schema).

In summary, while no existing tests can be re-run, the migration to the Gemini API and changes to reporting necessitate the creation of a robust new set of integration, functional, and error-handling tests to ensure system stability and correctness.
