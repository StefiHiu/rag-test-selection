Detailed Developer Summary:

  This change introduces a simple CAPTCHA generation feature. A new method, `get_captcha()`, has been added to the `TestCaseRetriever` class, which generates a random 6-character alphanumeric string. The main execution block has been updated to call this new method and print the generated CAPTCHA string to the console, ostensibly for human verification.
