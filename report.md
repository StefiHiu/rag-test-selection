🔍 Detailed Developer Summary:

  In `analysis/gemini_summarizer.py`, the method for configuring the Gemini API key has been updated. The `os` module was imported, and the previously hardcoded `api_key` within `genai.configure()` has been replaced. The API key is now fetched from the system's environment variables using `os.getenv("API_KEY")`. This change, which also resolves a merge conflict, improves security by removing sensitive credentials from the source code and makes configuration more flexible.
